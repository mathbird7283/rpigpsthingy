# INTRODUCTION

This is a currently ongoing project involving a customized GoogleMaps-like GPS system for the RPI campus. This is currently accessible as a Python file that inputs a few initial values and generates a list of successively improving paths between the two points.

# VERSIONS

Version 1.0

This currently has:
1) an improved algorithm that allows the analysis of the paths between a point in downtown Troy and a point on Freshman hill in under one minute. This, however, I would like to improve further with Dijkstra's Algorithm.

2) A graphical representation for the campus, written using a Kalamazoo.edu-generated graphics module in Python

# PREREQUISITES

Python 2.7. I believe 2.5-2.7 will al work. 3.x will not work properly because of the print function.
